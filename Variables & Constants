1. What is a variable
When a program is running it needs to work with data. For example, a calculator would need to store the numbers a user inputs to be able to do some calculations.
This data is temporarily stored in the memory (RAM) of your computer throughout the life of the program. When the program stops running, the data is removed from memory.
2. How to create (declare) a variable
Cu phap: 
    type indentifier;
Example:
  using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        int shoes;
    }
}
3. How to assign data to a variable
Syntax: indentifier = value;
Example:
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        int shoes;
        shoes = 10;
    }
}
4. How to initialize a variable
Syntax: 
  type indentifier = value;
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        int shoes = 10;
    }
}
5. How to use var as an automatic type
Example:
  // compiled as an int
var shoes = 10;

// compiled as a string
var message = "Hello";

// compiled as int array
var numbers = new[] { 0, 1, 2 };

// compiled as List<int>
var list = new List<int>();

6. What is a constant
Constants are almost exactly the same as variables, the only differences are:

A constant’s value cannot change during runtime, it’s immutable.
A constant is declared with the const keyword before the type.
A constant must be initialized, that’s to say, it must have a value when declared.
Example:
  const float pi = 3.14f;
